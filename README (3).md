# Knee-Osteoarthritis-Image-Classification
The goal of our analysis is to recognize and classify the knee osteoarthritis images.

The dataset contains around 10k knee X-ray images for both knee joint detection and knee KL grading. The grade descriptions are as follows:
- Healthy
- Doubtful: doubtful joint narrowing with possible osteophytic lipping
- Minimal: definite presence of osteophytes and possible joint space narrowing;
- Moderate: multiple osteophytes, definite joint space narrowing, with mild sclerosis;
- Severe: large osteophytes, significant joint narrowing, and severe sclerosis.
